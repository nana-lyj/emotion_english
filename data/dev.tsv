1	'But could we not ask little Hans up here?' said the Miller's youngest son.	6
2	'Nay,' answered the Hare, 'but as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with thee,' and it ran away swiftly, and the Star–Child went towards the city.	4
3	'Oh! they will come to you,' said the Miller, 'but you must take more pains.	7
4	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
5	'The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,' whispered the Turtle–doves to each other.	7
6	'Upon my word,' said the Miller, 'you are very lazy.	2
7	A delightful voice, certainly, continued the Frog; "I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.	7
8	And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.	6
9	And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, 'Who is thy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?'	4
10	And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.	4
11	And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was.	8
12	And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.	6
13	And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they had seen his mother.	7
14	And on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the magicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, 'In a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three pieces of gold.	7
15	And one evening he came to the gate of a strong–walled city that stood by a river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.	7
16	And the Hare answered him, and said: 'Surely thou hast given me freedom, and what shall I give thee in return?'	7
17	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
18	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
19	And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.	5
20	As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.	7
21	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
22	BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket? he said, as he whirled through the air; "impossible! GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.	6
23	Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do.	3
24	But I am going to buy them all back again now.'	8
25	But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.	5
26	But the little ducks paid no attention to her.	7
27	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
28	But the Tree shook its head.	1
29	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	1
30	But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, 'Why, thou art as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.	5
31	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	0
32	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	1
33	He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.	4
34	He was very much admired indeed.	4
35	How lucky you mentioned it!	6
36	However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market.	7
37	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.'	2
38	I hate people who cry over spilt milk.	5
39	I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man.	6
40	I like hearing myself talk.	0
41	I like the Miller immensely.	8
42	If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.	7
43	In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be.	5
44	Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art."	6
45	It is just like being in church.'	4
46	It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.	0
47	It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow–trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s–throw away.	0
48	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	0
49	It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.	0
50	Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.	0
51	My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction.	0
52	One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.	0
53	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	1
54	Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.	5
55	So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.'	7
56	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
57	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	3
58	So the Star–Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.	0
59	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
60	That is not conversation.	8
61	That is the important thing.	4
62	The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.	0
63	The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.	4
64	Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.	6
65	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	3
66	There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.	7
67	They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.	0
68	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
69	What a very stupid thing to do'!	8
70	Whizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.	6
71	Why is he weeping? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.	6
72	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	3
73	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
74	You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose, cried the Student.	7
75	You will hear our glee-club this evening.	7
76	You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.	0
