1	'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?'	3
2	'Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller, 'friendship never forgets.	4
3	'Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,' she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.	0
4	'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	8
5	'The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.'	7
6	'What is it?' she cried.	7
7	Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents, said the Waterrat, "I am not a family man. 	5
8	Ah! what a trivial view of life! said the Rocket; "but it is only what I expected.	5
9	Ahem! ahem! he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, "Romance is dead."	8
10	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket angrily.	2
11	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket, and he began to cough.	8
12	All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.	4
13	And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.	2
14	And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.	1
15	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.'	3
16	And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.	0
17	And the Mole answered, 'Thou hast blinded mine eyes.	2
18	And the Star–Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and his comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he had not seen there before.	6
19	And the Star–Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood of which the Magician had spoken to him.	7
20	And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, 'What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?	4
21	And was it not ten years from this day?'	7
22	As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.	7
23	At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.	1
24	But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.'	6
25	But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.	1
26	But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.	1
27	Even the cattle of the field praise Him.'	0
28	Everybody can see that.'	6
29	God made the blind–worm and the mole, and each has its place.	4
30	He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.	4
31	He was a very selfish Giant.	5
32	How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye!	8
33	However, they did not seem to have much effect.	1
34	I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered, "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."	3
35	I am made for public life, said the Rocket, "and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them.	7
36	I am off to look for my daughters.	8
37	I have six beautiful daughters.	0
38	I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news."	4
39	I pray thee send for him quickly, for in search of him have I wandered over the whole world.'	0
40	If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.'	3
41	In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!"	6
42	In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.	7
43	In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.	1
44	Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship."	0
45	It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.	0
46	It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name", and he leaned down and plucked it.	6
47	It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.	0
48	It saves time, and prevents arguments."	8
49	It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself.	8
50	Now I am going off! he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.	7
51	One red rose is all I want, cried the Nightingale, "only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?"	7
52	Order! order! cried out a Cracker.	2
53	Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.'	7
54	Pray, what are you laughing at? inquired the Rocket.	6
55	She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.	2
56	She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."	1
57	Sing me one last song, he whispered, "I shall feel very lonely when you are gone."	7
58	So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.	0
59	Somebody must listen, answered the Frog, "and I like to do all the talking myself.	8
60	Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.'	4
61	The air was foul and heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp. 	5
62	The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.	1
63	The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.	8
64	The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.	6
65	Their little pink feet were quite frost–bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.	0
66	Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with the rose in his hand.	7
67	Then you are quite behind the age, said the Water-rat.	6
68	Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy, said the Dragonfly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.	7
69	There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.	6
70	They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. 	5
71	This must be the deputation, said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified.	8
72	What a terrible misfortune! 	3
73	Who is there who careth for us?	3
74	Why doesn’t the Government look to it?'	2
75	Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.	8
76	Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.	0
