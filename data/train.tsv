1	Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.	0
2	'I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.	1
3	Conversation, indeed! said the Rocket.	8
4	It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.	1
5	And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.	2
6	Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France.	0
7	Well, that is his loss, not mine, answered the Rocket.	8
8	My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.	3
9	The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain–Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice–King had kissed her.	6
10	I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be spoiled.	4
11	OLD Stick! said the Rocket, "impossible! GOLD Stick, that is what he said.	6
12	So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.	0
13	She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.	8
14	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?"	2
15	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
16	And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, 'What robe is this that thou art weaving?'	3
17	'We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,' said the Miller, 'and wondered how you were getting on.'	8
18	The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.	1
19	It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, "otherwise you would know who I am.	2
20	During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.	1
21	He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.	5
22	He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney- pots down.	2
23	Wherefore I must go hence, and wander through the world till I find her, and she give me her forgiveness.'	7
24	The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.	4
25	It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.	4
26	Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them, and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.	0
27	Here indeed is the true lover, said the Nightingale.	0
28	My roses are yellow, it answered, "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.	0
29	He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.	4
30	For a red rose? they cried, "how very ridiculous!" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.	5
31	But they have not lost their only son, said the Roman Candle; "no misfortune has happened to them at all."	6
32	And he bound the eyes of the Star–Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.	6
33	'My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, 'you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.	0
34	'How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale, 'really I feel quite drowsy. 	0
35	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
36	If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.	1
37	It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name"; and he leaned down and plucked it.	4
38	And the Squirrel answered, 'Thou hast slain mine.	1
39	There is no good talking to him, said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; "no good at all, for he has gone away."	6
40	'Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?	7
41	'Nay,' he cried, laughing, 'but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	0
42	I don't understand you, answered the Water-rat.	5
43	But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
44	You are blind now, he said, "so I will stay with you always."	4
45	'Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,' they cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.	7
46	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
47	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	4
48	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
49	'Hans,' said the Miller, 'I will give you my wheelbarrow.	7
50	Wherefore I will go and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.'	7
51	Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.	8
52	So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star–Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them.	6
53	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
54	That is the new method.	7
55	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
56	After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.	6
57	But where is your little companion? he said: "the boy I put into the tree."	7
58	Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.	6
59	I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion, said the Rocket; "no doubt that is what it means," and he looked more supercilious than ever.	5
60	There is neither society here, nor solitude.	1
61	You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow, said the Giant.	7
62	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.'	2
63	And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?	3
64	Hallo! he cried, "what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.	2
65	Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something."	8
66	Is the story about me? asked the Water-rat.	0
67	I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.	2
68	It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.	4
69	Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?'	7
70	What a strange thing! said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.	6
71	He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.	8
72	Why, indeed? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.	6
73	Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.	5
74	'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.'	0
75	'They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, 'and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.	0
76	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
77	So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.	1
78	'Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have need of many things.'	4
79	In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.	7
80	I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.	7
81	'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and he went to work at once.	0
82	But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, 'Didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest?	7
83	You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.	1
84	A new arrival, I see! said the Frog.	6
85	But he said to her, 'I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,' and he stirred not from the threshold.	6
86	It is your garden now, little children, said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. 	7
87	'If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.'	0
88	It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.	0
89	'Truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'it was even as thou sayest.'	0
90	But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.	1
91	I remember myself once--But it is no matter now. 	8
92	To–day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.	2
93	A horrible odour filled the place. 	5
94	We don't know, answered the children; "he has gone away."	8
95	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have it not.'	8
96	But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.	6
97	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
98	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
99	Boom! Boom! went the Roman Candle.	6
100	And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star–Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.	5
101	That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.	4
102	The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.	1
103	Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.	8
104	'Thou art mad to say so,' cried the Star–Child angrily. 	2
105	Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.	8
106	Let the fireworks begin, said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.	7
107	It took him the whole day to get there and back, and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.	0
108	And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.	1
109	'That was kind of you,' said Hans, 'I was half afraid you had forgotten me.'	4
110	And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.	0
111	I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here."	7
112	Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from noon to sunset.	1
113	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.'	2
114	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'	3
115	What right have you to be happy?	8
116	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.'	4
117	I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor.	8
118	So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.	3
119	Well, after all there is nothing like mud.	8
120	The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.	8
121	It is really too dreadful!	3
122	What a terrible misfortune! 	1
123	And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.	4
124	Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.	1
125	It may be so with you, he answered; "indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different.	8
126	And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.	1
127	'Nay,' said the Star–Child, 'but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.'	5
128	But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
129	Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.	6
130	I had thoughts of entering public life once myself, remarked the Duck; "there are so many things that need reforming.	4
131	The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.	0
132	So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.	0
133	All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.	1
134	I don't think much of that, said the Duck, "as I cannot see what use it is to any one.	2
135	And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.	0
136	Romance is a thing of the past."	1
137	'Nonsense!' growled the Wolf.	2
138	I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.	5
139	Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,' and they drave him out of the garden.	2
140	Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.	0
141	Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.	3
142	He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.	7
143	The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.	1
144	This is evidently a deputation, said the Rocket; "I will receive them with becoming dignity" so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.	8
145	'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'	4
146	What I sing of, he suffers--what is joy to me, to him is pain.	1
147	But none of you have any hearts.	5
148	And wherever the Star–Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star–Child bade them do, that did they.	8
149	You have talked the whole time yourself.	8
150	Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.	7
151	Why, I don't believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has, and she got up from her chair and went into the house.	5
152	His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire, but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.	7
153	What a curious thing! he cried; "there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.	6
154	Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.	4
155	I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood.	1
156	And when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.	7
157	'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.	0
158	'I am seeking for my mother,' he answered, 'and I pray ye to suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.'	7
159	There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.	0
160	I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.	4
161	There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,' the Miller used to say to his wife, 'for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.	4
162	He said to the Mole, 'Thou canst go beneath the earth. Tell me, is my mother there?'	3
163	And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: 'Wilt thou not close the door?	3
164	And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them to her.	0
165	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.'	3
166	And what dost thou seek in the wood?'	8
167	'What do you want, little Hans?'	7
168	For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.'	1
169	And when he saw the Star–Child coming, he struck upon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and said, 'Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.	7
170	Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.	2
171	 For if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.	1
172	And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.	4
173	You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads, she kept saying to them, and every now and then she showed them how it was done.	6
174	Nonsense! said the Roman Candle.	2
175	Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean, said a Bengal Light; "I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister."	2
176	'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'	4
177	And the Woodcutter answered, 'Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and it is ten years from this day.'	0
178	Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.	6
179	Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	7
180	The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.	5
181	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.	0
182	Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?	7
183	In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.	0
184	But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, where is my mother?	2
185	And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir–tree, and was lonely, he said, 'Where is my mother?'	0
186	Gold Stick is very complimentary.	8
187	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
188	But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.	1
189	One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red.	6
190	If you want a red rose, said the Tree, "you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood.	5
191	'Truly,' answered his companion, 'much is given to some, and little is given to others.	1
192	Oh! dear no, cried the Rocket.	6
193	Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.	1
194	I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.	7
195	'Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,' he answered.	4
196	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
197	But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down his shield and cried, 'Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill–favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.	5
198	I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.	7
199	The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.	0
200	Nay, but it is a Star–Child,' he answered, and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it.	0
201	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
202	Here is the reddest rose in all the world.	0
203	The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.	0
204	From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.	6
205	She has form, he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove--"that cannot be denied to her, but has she got feeling?	5
206	And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, 'The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred–fold.'	0
207	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?'	2
208	Ungrateful! said the girl.	6
209	Why, indeed? said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.	6
210	Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.'	0
211	My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."	3
212	How should I know?'	5
213	I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.'	7
214	He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.	8
215	You are a very irritating person," said the Rocket, "and very illbred.	2
216	So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.	7
217	Quack, quack, quack, she said.	8
218	Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. 	1
219	Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.	7
220	Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar–woman.	7
221	May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?	6
222	'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy to-day.	1
223	She would not sacrifice herself for others.	5
224	Why, you don't even know him, growled the Roman Candle.	5
225	He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.	1
226	But his companion answered him: 'Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.'	4
227	But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?	4
228	So the Hail came. 	8
229	How very silly of him not to stay here! said the Rocket.	2
230	And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.	1
231	My own garden is my own garden, said the Giant; "any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself."	8
232	There was no doubt about it.	4
233	'Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?' he asked.	8
234	And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'	3
235	He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.	1
236	What are you doing here? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.	2
237	I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.	4
238	Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder.	6
239	For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.	8
240	All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.	7
241	It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.	0
242	Only true lovers could drink out of this cup.	4
243	So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.	8
244	But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.	4
245	What an honour! cried all the courtiers.	6
246	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'	3
247	His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.	0
248	And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.	0
249	There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.	5
250	Let me tell you a story on the subject, said the Linnet.	7
251	He saw a most wonderful sight. 	6
252	After the banquet there was to be a Ball.	7
253	In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.	8
254	Tell it to me, said the Nightingale, "I am not afraid."	4
255	There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.	0
256	Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding, and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh–water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again, and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.	3
257	Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet–scented flowers, and the Star–Child entered it gladly.	0
258	The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.	6
259	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, "I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
260	But the Tree shook its head.	1
261	He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.	2
262	For I have suffered much to find thee.'	7
263	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of white gold?'	7
264	Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, 'Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?	1
265	And one of them said to the other: 'This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?	5
266	Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.	3
267	For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.	1
268	See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	2
269	'Alack, goodman!' she murmured, 'have we not children of our own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?	5
270	I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever."	7
271	Then she gave one last burst of music.	7
272	She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses, cried the young Student, "but in all my garden there is no red rose."	7
273	And on the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the plain.	6
274	Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.	3
275	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
276	And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.	0
277	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
278	Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do."	5
279	When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.	6
280	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
281	How should I fly?'	5
282	But the Star–Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.	1
283	How fortunate it is for the King's son, he remarked, "that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off.	7
284	Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.	4
285	Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'	5
286	You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain."	7
287	So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	7
288	What did he see?	6
289	But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. 	1
290	And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.	6
291	Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine–forest.	7
292	But the Star–Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.	0
293	So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.	6
294	In every tree that he could see there was a little child.	8
295	But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.	1
296	Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.	2
297	And the Star–Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, 'I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.'	4
298	Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.	0
299	His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.	1
300	I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.	8
301	A person of my position is never useful.	5
302	So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.	8
303	So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.	0
304	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.	0
305	Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, 'Tu–whit!Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	0
306	He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.	0
307	It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.	5
308	However, I excuse your ignorance.	4
309	She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.	0
310	But the girl frowned.	2
311	'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
312	Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.	1
313	And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'	4
314	And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.	1
315	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
316	What a silly question! cried the Water-rat.	2
317	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	0
318	Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.	0
319	I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.	5
320	True love suffers, and is silent.	1
321	'All right!' said the Doctor, and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind him.	7
322	Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that.	4
323	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	1
324	I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.	5
325	He was really very sorry for what he had done.	1
326	How selfish I have been! he said; "now I know why the Spring would not come here.	5
327	I am not laughing.	8
328	Climb up! little boy, said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.	8
329	But the girl frowned.	5
330	Then one of them caught sight of him.	8
331	It is going to rain sticks; and she rushed into the water.	3
332	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?'	8
333	'Little Hans, Doctor.'	6
334	So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart.	8
335	What a curious shape you are!	6
336	It is not comfortable here, he remarked, "but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
337	I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day', and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.	0
338	I tell you what, you are very rude, and, after all, who are you?	2
339	Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.	6
340	Be happy, cried the Nightingale, "be happy, you shall have your red rose.	0
341	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3
342	And what would you do in return? said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.	7
343	He must have a truly romantic nature, said the Catherine Wheel, "for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about"; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.	6
344	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3
345	That is what is called sympathy.	4
346	And I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.	3
347	You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.'	7
348	And the Star–Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of God’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the beggar–woman.	7
349	They are like the Aurora Borealis, said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, "only much more natural.	8
350	If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.	7
351	'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	8
352	'Alas! my son,' she cried, 'wilt thou not kiss me before I go?	1
353	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
354	At last, however, the fire caught him.	8
355	Now I am going to explode, he cried.	3
356	So at the end of the King's garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.	7
357	Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, "so we will live here all the year round."	1
358	How I would like to see him! he used to say.	7
359	'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.	2
360	The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.	1
361	One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. 	8
362	But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.	1
363	From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.	6
364	 'Besides,' he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that 'is an act of pure generosity.'	0
365	Dear me! said the little Squib, "I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour."	6
366	'Thou speakest truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.'	0
367	I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.	1
368	Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.	0
369	They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.	5
370	And the Star–Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.	7
371	'Come thou with me,' said the Hare, 'and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.'	6
372	The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.	3
373	It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.	3
374	And they said to him, 'It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.'	1
375	Nay! answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."	4
376	But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.	3
377	Thy mother dwells not in this city.'	1
378	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
379	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.	2
380	And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling to him, 'My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy crown?'	6
381	'Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, 'I am in great trouble.	1
382	And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'	3
383	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."	2
384	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
385	He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.	1
386	You certainly are! cried the Bengal Light.	6
387	Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.	0
388	The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.	5
389	In fact, it is essentially suburban.	5
390	He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.	3
391	TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED	3
392	My roses are white, it answered, "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.	0
393	Once upon a time, said the Linnet, "there was an honest little fellow named Hans."	0
394	Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.	1
395	I hope not, said the Frog complacently.	7
396	You had really better keep yourself dry, said the Fire-balloon.	4
397	So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.	1
398	The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none.	8
399	'Lots of people act well,' answered the Miller, 'but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also', and he	0
400	But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.	7
401	Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees.	8
402	'Do you really think I shall?' asked little Hans.	0
403	And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.	4
404	How happy we were there, they said to each other.	1
405	And the Star–Child frowned and said to himself, 'What is this that they say to me?	6
406	And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.	7
407	I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.	4
408	But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star–Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.	4
409	Just look at those yellow tulips.	6
410	At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.	7
411	But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's heart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.	4
412	Tell me, canst thou see my mother?'	3
413	And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.	6
414	Yes, that is just what I want to know, said the Duck, and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.	6
415	Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale.	0
416	He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered 'Pooh!'	8
417	Therefore weep no more but be glad.'	0
418	'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.'	4
419	I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all.	5
420	One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.	8
421	However, I don't care a bit.	8
422	Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.	1
423	But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.	1
424	'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.	0
425	And being weary she sat her down under a chestnut–tree to rest.	8
426	But he answered him: 'Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,' and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.	8
427	'Weet! weet! weet!' twittered the green Linnets, 'the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.'	6
428	'Ugh!' snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, 'this is perfectly monstrous weather.	2
429	He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.	5
430	Romance never dies.	7
431	Well, I said Pylotechnic, answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.	2
432	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
433	What a curious shape you are!	6
434	If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.	7
435	For I see none here but this vile beggar–woman.'	1
436	I never said I knew him, answered the Rocket.	4
437	But nobody saw him.	1
438	Good heavens! cried the Goose.	6
439	But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.	3
440	Was he very distinguished? asked the Water-rat.	7
441	What disobedient children! cried the old Water-rat, "they really deserve to be drowned." 	5
442	What a pity!	1
443	Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.'	8
444	The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.	1
445	And the Linnet answered, 'Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
446	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.	7
447	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
448	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: 'The fly is thy brother.	4
449	Why! 	6
450	But the Tree shook its head.	1
451	As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: "Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!" he said.	6
452	'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire, 'very thoughtful indeed.	0
453	 I shall never get over it."	1
454	Flamecoloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.	6
455	And the Star–Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	7
456	The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads. 	2
457	Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.	4
458	They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.	2
459	The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night, murmured the young Student, "and my love will be of the company.	7
460	Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.'	4
461	And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.	0
462	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.	7
463	Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.'	8
464	Look, look! cried the Tree, "the rose is finished now", but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.	7
465	The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.	3
466	What are fireworks like? she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.	7
467	I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.	4
468	You were talking about yourself, replied the Roman Candle.	8
469	But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected."	1
470	Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.	6
471	But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.	1
472	Get thee gone.	2
473	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
474	Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden.	7
475	So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.	3
476	Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. 	6
477	At present you have only the practice of friendship, some day you will have the theory also.'	6
478	And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.	1
479	Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead, she murmured.	1
480	'And what signs didst thou find with him?' she cried.	7
481	I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.'	7
482	'It is some poor traveller,' said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.	7
483	And the woman answered him, 'I am thy mother.'	0
484	And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.	6
485	And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend? asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.	4
486	He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.	8
487	No, answered the Linnet, "I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.	0
488	But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her", and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.	1
489	The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.	5
490	Certainly not, answered the Linnet, "that is the beginning."	7
491	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
492	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
493	The poor children had now nowhere to play.	1
494	But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. 	3
495	And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star–Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: 'Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?'	2
496	But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
497	But pray go on with your story.	8
498	What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good."	5
499	His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense."	7
500	That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.	2
501	Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.	4
502	Snare them not for thy pleasure.	4
503	Do it no harm.	4
504	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
505	When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.	8
506	She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.	4
507	BAD and GRAND sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same"; and he fell into the mud.	5
508	'It is not a very big plank,' said the Miller, looking at it, 'and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with, but, of course, that is not my fault.	5
509	And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the sleeping child.	6
510	And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, 'Why art thou watching me?	2
511	Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.	5
512	The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.	4
513	And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, 'He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.	0
514	And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying.	0
515	I am afraid not.	5
516	Poor people, to lose their only son!	1
517	Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.	8
518	That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life.	0
519	So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	7
520	I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
521	So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.	6
522	I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.	4
523	I believe the Spring has come at last, said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.	7
524	Any place you love is the world to you, exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; "but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.	1
525	And he answered, 'My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated her evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.'	7
526	He said to the Linnet, 'Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees, and canst see the whole world.	7
527	So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.	0
528	'I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.'	0
529	She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.	4
530	Why, what a wonderful piece of luck! he cried, "here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.	7
531	The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.	0
532	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
533	And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.	8
534	So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.	6
535	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
536	'Well, for my own part,' said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, 'I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.	4
537	But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow.	5
538	He is too selfish, she said.	5
539	Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'	3
540	He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.	1
541	It is applicable to you, answered the Linnet, and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.	6
542	The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.	1
543	He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.	0
544	And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold.	7
545	As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one's mind from higher things."	8
546	When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.	4
547	Only a Student.	6
548	In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.	6
549	And who giveth us food?'	3
550	“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, "every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient."	4
551	But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.	3
552	You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.	4
553	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
554	'A plank of wood'! said the Miller, 'why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn.	0
555	So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.	8
556	'Follow me,' cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water.	7
557	Hallo! cried one of the boys, "look at this old stick! I wonder how it came here"; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.	6
558	But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.	1
559	Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.	5
560	You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.	3
561	She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.	7
562	'Quite full?' said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.	1
563	And an old and evil–visaged man who was passing by called out, and said, 'I will buy him for that price,' and, when he had paid the price, he took the Star–Child by the hand and led him into the city.	7
564	'If in very truth thou art my mother,' he said, 'it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.	1
565	And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black–haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.	0
566	You should be thinking about others.	8
567	Dost thou seek to slay thine also?'	3
568	Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. 	2
569	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
570	For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving–kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.	1
571	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
572	Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"	7
573	My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.	4
574	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
575	'The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,' she murmured, 'but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.	7
576	And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, 'Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.	1
577	All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."	5
578	There is away, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
579	Terribly cold it certainly was.	3
580	Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.'	8
581	Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial."	5
582	'Buy back your wheelbarrow?	8
583	In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.	4
584	Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.	2
585	'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'	3
586	Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.	7
587	What is a sensitive person? said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.	8
588	Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle.	8
589	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
590	But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.	4
591	Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.	7
592	My roses are red, it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.	0
593	Well, well, said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, "everybody has different tastes.	8
594	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, 'I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once.	0
595	Is that the end of the story? asked the Water-rat.	6
596	And the Hare said to him, 'The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.	6
597	'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'	3
598	And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'	1
599	Come back! come back! screamed the Rocket, "I have a great deal to say to you"; but the Duck paid no attention to him.	8
600	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.'	3
601	She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.	7
602	Get thee gone.	2
603	We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer's house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.	8
604	And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay.	3
605	And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.	8
606	And he certainly did explode.	6
607	Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.	2
608	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.'	0
609	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	0
610	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
611	Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.	4
612	In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.	7
613	Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!	1
614	And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap, And the Hare said to him, 'Why art thou weeping?	1
615	But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.	3
616	Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.	6
